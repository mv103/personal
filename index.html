          I am a first year undergraduate at the University of Washington, but originally from
          Vancouver, WA. While I am studying Computer Engineering, I am constantly finding ways to
          continue my passion for experimentation in fields of knowledge, exploration in design, and
          celebration of my Asian American culture.

          <h2>Design CoMission Internship with LSW Architects</h2>
          <h3>"The Marshall Park Project</h3>
          <p>
            As a project intern, I participated in the redesign of a local park with the objective of
            creating an ADA compliant and community uplifting environment.
            I worked in a mentor led team to research, coordinate, and deliver a final
            design presentation to clients and staff.
          </p>
          <h2>Our Objective</h2>
          <p>
            Currently in Marshall Park, there is a lack of inclusion for people of all abilities
            and ages. While Harper's Playground is taking a contemporary approach to Marshall's
            Park by breaking the stereotypical structure of a “playground,” the Marshall Park
            project aims to further communicate their mission of inclusivity throughout the park by
            incorporating diverse opportunities. We will give every visitor the opportunity to feed
            their mind, body and soul with fulfilling designs that improve community interaction,
            offer stimulating experiences with nature, and provide accessible athletic grounds.
            This will ensure that every visit to Marshall Park will encourage engagement with one's
            intellectual, emotional and physical vitality, regardless of limitations.
