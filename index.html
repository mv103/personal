          I am a first year undergraduate at the University of Washington, but originally from
          Vancouver, WA. While I am studying Computer Engineering, I am constantly finding ways to
          continue my passion for experimentation in fields of knowledge, exploration in design, and
          celebration of my Asian American culture.

        <h2>Design CoMission Internship<br><span> with LSW Architects</span></h2>
        <h3><em>"The Marshall Park Project"</em></h3>
        <p>
          As a project intern, I participated in the redesign of a local park with the objective of
          creating an ADA compliant and community uplifting environment.
          I worked in a mentor led team to research, coordinate, and deliver a final
          design presentation to clients and staff.
        </p>
        <h2 id="objective">Our Objective</h2>
        <p>
          Currently in Marshall Park, there is a lack of inclusion for people of all abilities
          and ages. While Harper's Playground is taking a contemporary approach to Marshall's
          Park by breaking the stereotypical structure of a “playground,” the Marshall Park
          project aims to further communicate their mission of inclusivity throughout the park by
          incorporating diverse opportunities. We will give every visitor the opportunity to feed
          their mind, body and soul with fulfilling designs that improve community interaction,
          offer stimulating experiences with nature, and provide accessible athletic grounds.
          This will ensure that every visit to Marshall Park will encourage engagement with one's
          intellectual, emotional and physical vitality, regardless of limitations.

        <h2>Exploration of fashion and reusability</h2>
        <h3><em>"Sustainable Bags"</em></h3>
        <p>
          Prompted by the sustainable fashion movement, the mission to reduce textile waste and
          minimize my overall carbon footprint, I accepted the challenge of learning to sew by
          machine. Through sewing and upcycling, I took the first steps to research sustainability
          and incorporate it into my lifestyle realizing the importance of conservation.
          As I continue to study, I am motivated by my passions for art, culture, and environment
          and seek further understanding of diversity, energy-efficient practices, and artistry
          prevalent in influential technology today.
